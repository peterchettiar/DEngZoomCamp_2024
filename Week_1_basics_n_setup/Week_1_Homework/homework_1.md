### Question 1. Knowing docker tags

We run the `docker run --help` command to access the `--help` documentation for the `docker run` command. When you actually run the command, it gives you an exhaustive list of options, as well as their short descriptions, that potentially could be appended to the `docker run` command. This really depends on what is the outcome you are trying to achieve.

So the question is:

_Which tag has the following text?_

```bash
Automatically remove the container when it exits
```
The answer is `-rm` (see image below).
